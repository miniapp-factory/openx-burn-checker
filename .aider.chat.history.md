The changes you’re asking for will touch the following files in your repository:

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – to update the app’s title and description.  
2. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – to generate a new logo for the app.

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

A stylized representation of the $OPENX token as a circular coin with a subtle gradient from deep blue to teal, overlaid with a dynamic flame effect rising from the center. The flame is rendered in warm orange and red hues, giving the impression of a token being burned. The background is a soft, light gray gradient that provides contrast without distracting from the coin and flame. The overall composition conveys the concept of a token burn alert in a clean, modern style suitable for a web application logo.
