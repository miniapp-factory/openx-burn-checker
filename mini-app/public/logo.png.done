A stylized representation of the $OPENX token as a circular coin with a subtle gradient from deep blue to teal, overlaid with a dynamic flame effect rising from the center. The flame is rendered in warm orange and red hues, giving the impression of a token being burned. The background is a soft, light gray gradient that provides contrast without distracting from the coin and flame. The overall composition conveys the concept of a token burn alert in a clean, modern style suitable for a web application logo.
